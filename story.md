Certainly! Let’s break down your story premise using the provided schemas and context.

**1. THEME**

A classic fit here would be **courage** and **identity**, with secondary emphasis on **hope** and **belonging**.

- **Conflict Pairings:**
  - *Courage*: Fear vs. duty (Will the hero risk their safety to help others?)
  - *Identity*: Belonging vs. alienation (Does the hero feel like an outsider in this magical world?)
  - *Hope*: Despair vs. possibility
- **Moral Payoff Template:**  
  “In the end, the hero learns that true courage means facing your fears, and that belonging can be found by helping others.”
- **Age Suitability:**  
  Safe for most age bands if the darkness is more symbolic or not too scary.

- **Mini Prompt Seed:**  
  *At moment of crisis, hero must choose between returning to their own safe world or risking everything to save the magical world → theme of courage.*

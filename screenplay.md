LILA AVERY (13, wiry, wild hair, bright eyes) sits alone on a swing, fidgeting with a battered flashlight. Fireflies blink in the long grass. Voices from a distant house—family inside, laughter she isn’t part of.

LILA  
(softly, to herself)  
Maybe tomorrow I’ll actually be brave.

She points her flashlight at the shadows. The beam flickers, then—briefly—glows with an odd, silvery shimmer.

She leans forward, curious.

Lila, drawn by the strange light, pushes through tangled undergrowth. The air hums. She stumbles onto a stone arch, half-buried in moss. Her flashlight flickers wildly.

A shimmer. The portal pulses. Lila hesitates, then steps through.

Lila lands on soft moss. The world is strange—trees glow faintly, unseen creatures rustle nearby.

A small, fox-like CREATURE (later “BRIAR”) emerges, eyes wary.

BRIAR  
(suspicious)  
You don’t belong here.

LILA  
(trying to sound braver than she feels)  
Maybe not. But I found the door.

BRIAR  
(sniffing)  
That’s not the same as belonging.

LILA  
(defensive, quietly)  
I never belong anywhere.

Briar studies her, then beckons, tail flicking.

BRIAR  
Come on. Before the darkness notices you.

MONTAGE — shots:  
— Lila racing Briar through glowing ferns.  
— Lila marveling at floating lanterns.  
— Meeting WILLOW, a wise elder, who gently tests her.  
— Lila laughing, the first time she looks at ease.

END MONTAGE.

WILLOW (60s, kind eyes) sits beside Lila by a lantern.

WILLOW  
(softly)  
Magic finds the lost, child. But it asks something in return.

LILA  
(nervous)  
What if I’m not enough?

WILLOW  
(smiling)  
Then let hope be your lantern.

Lila stands with Briar, watching as shadows creep along sanctuary walls. Creatures gather, fearful. The glowing lantern dims.

BRIAR  
(whispers)  
The darkness is growing.

LILA  
(voice trembling)  
Maybe I should go home. I can’t fix this.

Briar turns away, hurt.

BRIAR  
You could just run, like before.

Lila flinches, guilt written on her face.

Rain lashes the trees. Lila, backpack slung, stands by the now-flickering portal. She looks back—Briar and Willow are cornered by darkness.

LILA  
(voice cracking)  
I’m sorry… I can’t—

She turns to leave. Pauses. Hears Briar’s cry.

Lila’s hand tightens on her glowing lantern. Determined, she runs back toward her friends.

WILLOW  
(encouraging)  
You are the hope, Lila!

LILA  
(steeling herself)  
I’m not leaving anyone behind.

She raises the lantern, light flooding the fortress, dissolving darkness. The magical world glows anew.

Briar leaps to her side, triumphant.

BRIAR  
(grinning)  
Guess you belong after all.

LILA  
(laughing, tears in her eyes)  
Maybe I always did.

And I think I found where I belong.

She looks up as the sky brightens, hope shining in her eyes.

FADE OUT.
